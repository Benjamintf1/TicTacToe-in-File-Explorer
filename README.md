TicTacToe-in-File-Explorer
==========================

The goal of this game is to create a "game" in something that is not a programming language (based on a joke about coding a game in git), so this is TicTacToe with only empty files, folders and symbolic links. 
Note: Only works in Unix systems. 
WARNING: CREATES ~20k folders ~4523*9 symlinks. Plus ~15163 symlinks for 'Play_Again?' and same number of empty files. 
~Thanks to reddit user hxka for counting for me.




How to start
------------
Run python TicTacToe.py
Open up "START" in a file browser
Resize icons/window to make a 3x3 grid
X moves first
