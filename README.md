TicTacToe-in-File-Explorer
==========================

The goal of this game is to create a "game" in something that is not a programming language (based on a joke about coding a game in git), so this is TicTacToe with only empty files, folders and sybolic links. 
Note: Only works in Unix systems. 
WARNING: CREATES ~20k folders and about 20k*9 symbolic links.
